# Research Dumpster

This repository contains research proposals based on ideas I've had but didn't have time or resources to implement myself.

## About

The research proposals in this repository are researched and developed by an AI researcher. My process is straightforward:

1. I provide the AI researcher with an idea or concept I've been thinking about
2. The AI researcher develops a comprehensive research proposal around this concept
3. During the research process, the AI evaluates feasibility and practical applications

## Purpose

These proposals serve as a collection of potentially valuable ideas that:
- Explore whether concepts are technically feasible
- Identify existing similar research through extensive citations
- Outline implementation approaches
- Document potential challenges and solutions

Each proposal includes citations to relevant papers and prior art to establish connections to existing research and demonstrate proof of concept.

## Disclaimer

While these proposals are thoroughly researched with academic rigor, they represent initial explorations rather than completed work. They're shared here to inspire further research.
Some of the proposals may not even be completed yet.
